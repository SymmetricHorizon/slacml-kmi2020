# Data Challenge

Below is a summary of available workshop projects. Take a look at them and pick what you are interested in to attack.
There is no competition nor grading.
The point of the projects is to expose you to a spectrum of challenges and help productive learning experience.
Feel free to pick one or more topic, and work with your group members to contribute a project summary on Friday!

* Image classification ... [see this notebook](/IntroNeuralNetwork/Challenge-A.ipynb)
* Image segmentation ... [see this notebook](/IntroNeuralNetwork/Challenge-B.ipynb)
* Shower clustering ... [see this notebook](/GraphNeuralNetworks/Challenge.ipynb)

For each project, we give some pointers. 
But if you find something else interesting, feel free to explore your ideas/questions using these datasets.
